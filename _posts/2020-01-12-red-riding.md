At first glance, it’s just a multitool—maybe you’re thinking bottle opener, screwdriver, the usual.  But this tool? Completely useless… until you’re in the right place. This isn’t a multitool for fixing things. It is a multitool for purpose. 

This multitool only starts to make sense when you bring it to specific locations. It’s kind of like a scavenger hunt—you actually have to go there, physically, to see what it does. It doesn’t unlock anything mechanical; it reveals something about the place, maybe even about you. 

I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while: **do we always have to chase something to understand its value?** That question sits at the core of this project. The multitool, in a weird way, reflects how I see purpose—it doesn’t just show up, you have to seek it out. And maybe that’s the point.

So yeah, it’s a multitool. But not the kind you fix stuff with. More like the kind that gets you wondering why you're chasing things in the first place.
