So I’m building a multitool. And yeah, I know—when you hear "multitool," you're probably thinking bottle opener, screwdriver, maybe some weird fold-out thing you never actually use 😅. But mine? Honestly, it’s pretty useless. At least… until you’re in the right place.

This multitool only starts to make sense when you bring it to specific locations. It’s kind of like a scavenger hunt—you actually have to go there, physically, to see what it does. It doesn’t unlock anything mechanical; it reveals something about the place, maybe even about you.

An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”. 

I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while: do we always have to chase something to understand its value? That question sits at the core of this project. The multitool, in a weird way, reflects how I see purpose—it doesn’t just show up, you have to seek it out. And maybe that’s the point.

So yeah, it’s a multitool. But not the kind you fix stuff with. More like the kind that gets you wondering why you're chasing things in the first place.
