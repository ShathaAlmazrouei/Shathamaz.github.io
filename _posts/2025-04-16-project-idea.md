## Project: The Useless Multitool

So Iâ€™m building a multitool. And yeah, I knowâ€”when you hear "multitool," you're probably thinking bottle opener, screwdriver, maybe some weird fold-out thing you never actually use ðŸ˜…. But mine? Honestly, itâ€™s pretty useless. At leastâ€¦ until youâ€™re in the right place.

This multitool only starts to make sense when you bring it to specific locations. Itâ€™s kind of like a scavenger huntâ€”you actually have to go there, physically, to see what it does. It doesnâ€™t unlock anything mechanical; it reveals something about the place, maybe even about you. Itâ€™s not about utility in the classic senseâ€”itâ€™s about discovery.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about this idea for a while: do we always have to chase something to understand its value? That question sits at the core of this project. The multitool, in a weird way, reflects how I see purposeâ€”it doesnâ€™t just show up, you have to seek it out. And maybe thatâ€™s the point.

So yeah, itâ€™s a multitool. But not the kind you fix stuff with. More like the kind that gets you wondering why you're chasing things in the first place.
