The idea I have is a tool that, at first glance, seems useless — and in most situations, it would be. But when directed to specific locations, it reveals its value. It’s similar to how certain things in life may appear insignificant until we actively pursue or explore them. My concept is a multitool, including a bottle opener, that also serves as a scavenger hunt device around our campus. It encourages people to look deeper, explore more, and find meaning or purpose where it might not have been obvious before.
